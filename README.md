# Project Overview

In this project a web-based application is not tested by it's original developer. My task is to test the JavaScript code using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

## Completing the project

After learning the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549), I was given an [untested project](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) to test the functionality of the code.

* The required tests are to ensure
    - allFeeds are defined and is not empty
    - allFeeds have an url and is not empty
    - allFeeds have a name and is not empty
    - the menu is hidden by default
    - the menu appears and disappears on a click event
    - initial entries has a single .entry within the .feed container.
    - a loaded new feed from the loadFeed function is different from the previous one

## Running the application
